## Context

After backend live snapshot helpers exist, Agent Hub needs a local command that serves the existing viewer and current dashboard state without requiring repeated dashboard export commands.

## Scope

- Add agent-hub dashboard serve to the CLI with local bind defaults of 127.0.0.1 and a configurable port.
- Serve existing static viewer files from skills/list-agent-hub-issues/viewer/.
- Expose GET /api/state with dashboard schema version 3, live revision metadata, and Cache-Control: no-store.
- Expose GET /api/events using server-sent events for revision notifications.
- Expose GET /healthz for smoke checks.
- Reject POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests with 405.
- Keep the server implementation dependency-free with Python stdlib only.

## Out Of Scope

- No viewer live-mode client changes in this issue.
- No browser write APIs or mutation endpoints.
- No WebSocket, Node, Vite, React, CDN, auth, hosting, or Notion sync work.

## Done Criteria

- [ ] CLI parser accepts dashboard serve options without breaking dashboard export.
- [ ] Local server returns valid /api/state JSON for a temp hub.
- [ ] SSE endpoint emits a revision notification when backend source changes.
- [ ] Mutation HTTP methods are rejected.
- [ ] Static viewer files are served from the existing viewer directory.

## Verification Strategy

### Regression Target

The live dashboard needs a read-only local API surface that exposes current backend snapshots while refusing mutation paths.

### Test Plan

- [ ] Unit: python3 -m unittest tests.test_agent_hub_v3
- [ ] Integration: server smoke against a temp hub for /, /api/state, /api/events, and /healthz
- [ ] Manual / inspection: verify POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE return 405

### First Test

Path: tests/test_agent_hub_v3.py::AgentHubV3CliTests.test_dashboard_serve_exposes_read_only_state_api
Expected initial result: fails before dashboard serve and its state endpoint exist
Reason this proves the regression or requirement: it locks the public CLI/API shape and read-only behavior before implementation

### Final Verification

Commands: python3 -m unittest tests.test_file_hub_backend tests.test_agent_hub_v3
Expected result: focused live backend and CLI/server tests pass

### Untestable Surface

None beyond browser visual fidelity, which must be covered by desktop and mobile smoke evidence where the issue touches UI.

## Assumptions

- The serve command is local-first and not a hosted product surface.
- SSE is preferred for lightweight updates, with client polling fallback implemented separately.

## Dependencies

- hub-viewer-live-snapshot-cache must provide revision-aware read-only state helpers.

## Open Questions

None.

### Progress
Date: 2026-07-03T15:56:58.720311Z
Agent: Codex
Summary: Added failing-first CLI/server regression for dashboard serve, then implemented a dependency-free stdlib local read-only dashboard server backed by DashboardLiveSnapshotCache.
Evidence: tests/test_agent_hub_v3.py; skills/manage-agent-hub-issues/scripts/agent_hub.py; red test failed because argparse rejected dashboard serve; server exposes /healthz, static viewer, /api/state, /api/events SSE, and 405 mutation responses.
Verification: python3 -m unittest tests.test_agent_hub_v3.AgentHubV3Tests.test_dashboard_serve_exposes_read_only_state_api -> OK; python3 -m unittest tests.test_file_hub_backend tests.test_agent_hub_v3 -> OK (25 tests); python3 -m unittest -> OK (51 tests); python3 -m py_compile skills/manage-agent-hub-issues/scripts/agent_hub.py -> OK.
Risks / skipped checks: No live client changes included by issue scope. Independent review subagent did not return before the wait timeout; local diff review and full tests completed.
Next step: Commit, push, open a normal PR, submit the issue to review, and release the work claim.
